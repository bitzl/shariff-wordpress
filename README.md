# Shariff for WordPress

This is the Shariff sharing plugin by Heise Zeitschriften Verlag / c't modified for WordPress.

From the original Shariff GitHub project:

> Shariff enables website users to share their favorite content without compromising their privacy.

> Facebook, Google+ and Twitter supply official sharing code snippets which quietly siphon personal data from all page visitors. Shariff enables visitors to see how popular your page is on Facebook and share your content with others without needless data leaks.

> Shariff `(/ˈʃɛɹɪf/)` is an open-source, low-maintenance, high-privacy solution maintained by German computer magazine c't and heise online.

To get all dependencies, run `./init-sub.sh` after getting the code. To create a WordPress plugin zip, run `./zip.sh` after that.
